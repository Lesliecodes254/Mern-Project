## 🎤 Sample Q&A Responses

**Q: Why did you choose MERN stack?**
A: MERN provides a complete JavaScript ecosystem, allowing me to use one language across the entire application. MongoDB's flexibility is perfect for evolving data structures, and React's component-based architecture makes the UI maintainable.

**Q: How does your app ensure data privacy?**
A: All passwords are hashed using Bcrypt, and user sessions are managed with JWT tokens. Mood data is only accessible to the authenticated user through protected API routes.

**Q: What was your biggest challenge?**
A: Implementing real-time chart updates was challenging. I solved it by properly managing React state and using useEffect hooks to re-fetch data when mood entries are added.

**Q: How would this scale?**
A: Currently, it uses MongoDB indexing for efficient queries. For scaling, I'd implement caching with Redis, add pagination for journal entries, and use a CDN for static assets.
